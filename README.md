# sih-smart-scheduler
Higher education institutions struggle with manual timetable creation, leading to class clashes, poor resource use, and uneven workloads. With NEP 2020 introducing multidisciplinary demands, an intelligent, web-based scheduling system is needed to optimize classrooms, faculty, and student needs.

Description

The current scheduling mechanism in most higher education institutes/colleges relies on manual input via spreadsheets or basic tools. These fail to account for real-time availability of faculty, room capacity, teaching load norms, subject combinations, and student preferences. A solution is required that will accommodate the various parameters required for scheduling classes for UG and PG students and return an optimized timetable ensuring:
* Maximized utilization of classrooms and laboratories
* Minimized workload on faculty members and students
* Achievement of required learning outcomes

Key Parameters

The following parameters can be taken into account as variables for creating optimized timetables:
* Number of classrooms available
* Number of batches of students
* Number of subjects to be taught in a particular semester
* Names of subjects
* Maximum number of classes per day
* Number of classes to be conducted for a subject per week / per day
* Number of faculties available for different subjects
* Average number of leaves a faculty member takes in a month
* Special classes that have fixed slots in timetable

Students may also consider additional variables that may help in effective timetable preparation.

Expected Solution

A web-based platform that can be linked to the college website. Authorized personnel will be able to login and input data against the listed variables to generate fully optimized timetables.

The platform should include:
* Login facility for authorized personnel to create and manage timetables
* Multiple options of optimized timetables to choose from
* Review and approval workflow for competent authorities
* Suggestions for suitable rearrangements when optimal solutions are not available
* Support for multi-department and multi-shift scheduling
